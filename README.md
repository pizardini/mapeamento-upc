# MapeamentoUpc
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.1.

You can access via [Github Pages](https://pizardini.github.io/mapeamento-upc/). But without the API data, this issue will be solve with a firebase implementation.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Json server

Run `node json-server.js` for the api simulated server called json-server. The API is acessible via browser at `http://localhost:3000\people`. The API is updated live.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `docs/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
